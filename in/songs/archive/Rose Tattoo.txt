[Am]The pictures tell the story, [C]this life has many shades
[G]I'd wake up every morning and [Am]before I'd start each day
[Am]I'd take a drag from last night's cigarette
[C]That smoldered in it's tray
[G]Down a little something, [Dm] then be on my way


I [Am]traveled far and wide and laid this[C] head in many ports
I was [G]guided by a compass, I saw [Am]beauty to the north
[Am]I drew the tales of many lives, and [C]wore the faces of my own
[G]I had these memories all around me
[Dm]So I wouldn't be alone


[C]Some may be from showing up, [G]others are from growing up
[Dm]Sometimes I was so messed up [Am]and didn't have a clue
[C]I ain't winning no one over, [G]I wear it just for you
I've got your [Dm]name written here in a [Am]rose tattoo


In a [Am]rose tattoo, in a [C]rose tattoo
I've got your [G]name written here
In a [Am]rose tattoo

                            
[Am]This one's for the mighty [C]sea, mischief, gold and piracy
[G]This one's for the man that raised me, [Am]taught me sacrifice and bravery
[Am]This one's for our favorite game, [C]black and gold, we wave the flag
[G]This one's for my family name, [Dm]with pride I wear it to the grave

[C]Some may be from showing up, [G]others are from growing up
[Dm]Sometimes I was so messed up [Am]and didn't have a clue
I ain't [C]winning no one over, [G]I wear it just for you
I've got your [Dm]name written here in a [Am]rose tattoo


In a [Am]rose tattoo, in a [C]rose tattoo
I've got your [G]name written here
In a [Am]rose tattoo

In a [Am]rose tattoo, in a [C]rose tattoo
I've got your [G]name written here
In a [Am]rose tattoo

This [F]one means the most to me, it [C]stays here for eternity
A [G]ship that always stays the course, an [Am]anchor for my every choice
A [F]rose that shines down from above, I [C]signed and sealed these words in blood
I [G]heard them once, sung in a song, [G]it played again and we sang along

       
[Am]You'll always be there with me
[C]Even if you're gone
[G]You'll always have my love
[Dm]Our memory will live on

[C]Some may be from showing up, [G]others are from growing up
[Dm]Sometimes I was so messed up [Am]and didn't have a clue
I ain't [C]winning no one over, [G]I wear it just for you
I've got your [Dm]name written here in a [Am]rose tattoo


In a [Am]rose tattoo, in a [C]rose tattoo
I've got your [G]name written here
In a [Am]rose tattoo
                  
In a [Am]rose tattoo in a [C]rose tattoo
With [G]pride I'll wear it to the [Am]grave for you
In a [C]rose tattoo in a [G]rose tattoo
I've [Dm]got your name written here, in [Am]a rose tattoo

In a [C]rose tattoo in a [G]rose tattoo
[Dm]Signed and sealed in blood I [Am]would die for you

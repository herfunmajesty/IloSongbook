[D/] You'll be the saddest part of me
[F#m/] A part of me that will never be [Bm/] Mine, 
it's obvious
[A/] Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

[D/] You're still the oxygen I breathe
[F#m/] I see your face when I close my [Bm/] eyes 
It's torturous
[A/] Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

<small><i>Verse (down-down)</i></small>
[D] There's a few lines that I have wrote
[F#m] In case of death, that's what I [Bm] want
That's what I [A] want

[D] So don't be sad when I'll be gone
[F#m] There's just one thing, I hope you [Bm] know
I loved you [A] so
  
<small><i>Pre-Chorus (down-down, riff)</i></small>
[D] Cause I don't even care about the time, I've got left here
[F#m] The only thing I know now is that I want to spend it
[Em/] With you, with you Nobody else here
[A/] Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

<small><i>Chorus (metal-strum)</i></small>
[D] You'll be the saddest part of me
[F#m] A part of me that will never be
[Bm] Mine, it's obvious
[G] Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
[D] You're still the oxygen I breathe
[F#m] I see your face when I close my [Bm] eyes
It's torturous
[A] Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
 
<small><i>(Verse down-down)</i></small>
[D] I'm sorry but I gotta go
[F#m] If you'll ever miss me, give this [Bm] song
Another [A] go
 
<small><i>Pre-Chorus (down-down, riff)</i></small>
[D] And I just keep on thinking how you made me feel better
[F#m] And all the crazy little things that we did together
[Em/] In the end, in the end It doesn't matter
[A/] If tonight is gonna be the loneliest
 
<small><i>Chorus (metal-strum)</i></small>
[D] You'll be the saddest part of me
[F#m] A part of me that will never be
[Bm] Mine, it's obvious

[F#m] I see your face when I close my [Bm] eyes
It's torturous

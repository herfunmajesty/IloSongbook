<small><i>(Intro)</i></small>
[Am7]  ...  [Dm7]  ...  [F]  ...  [Em]  ... <small><b>(x4)</b></small>  

<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
It's a human [Am7] sign  [Dm7] ...
When things go [F] wrong  [Em] ...
When the scent of her [Am7] lingers  [Dm7] ...
And temptation's [F] strong [Em] ...

<small><i>(Pre-Chorus)</i></small>
Cold, cold [Am7] heart  [Dm7] ...
Hardend by [F] you [Em] ...
Some things lookin' [Am7] better, baby [Dm7] ...
Just passin' [F] through (Oh [Em] no, no, no, no)

<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
[Am7] And I think it's gonna [Dm7] be a long, long [F] time
'Til touchdown [Em] brings me 'round again to [Am7] find
I'm not the [Dm7] man they think I am at [F] home
Oh no, no, [Em] no
And [Am7] this is what I [Dm7] should have 
[F] said  [Em] ...
Well I [Am7] thought it, but I [Dm7] kept it 
[F] hid [Em] ...

<small><i>(Pre-Chorus)</i></small>
Cold, cold [Am7] heart [Dm7] ...
Hardened by [F] you [Em] ...
Some things look [Am7] better, baby [Dm7] ...
Just passin' [F] through (Oh [Em] no, no, no, no)

<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
[Am7] And I think it's gonna [Dm7] be a long, long [F] time
'Til touchdown [Em] brings me 'round again to [Am7] find
I'm not the [Dm7] man they think I am at [F] home
Oh no, no, [Em] no (No, no, no, no)
And [Am7] this is what I [Dm7] should have 
[F] said [Em] ...
Well I [Am7] thought it, but I [Dm7] kept it 
[F] hid [Em] ...

<s>(Intro)</s>
[D] ... [Bm] ... <r>x2</r>

<s>(Verse)</s>
You [D] think you own whatever land you [Bm] land on
The [D] earth is just a dead thing you can [F#m] claim
But [Bm] I know every rock and tree [G] and creature
has a [Em//] life, has a [A7//] spirit, has a [Bm] name

You [D] think the only people who are [Bm] people
are the [D] people .. who look and think like [F#m] you
But [Bm] if you walk the footsteps of a [G] stranger
you'll learn [Em7//] things you never [A7//] knew you never [D] knew
 
<s>(Chorus)</s>
Have you [Bm] ever heard the wolf cry to the [F#m//] blue corn [G//] moon
or [Bm] asked the grinning bobcat why he [F#m] grinned
Can you [G//] sing with all the [A//] voices of the [D] mountain
Can you [Bm//] paint with all the [G//] colors of the [Bm7] wind
Can you [Em7//] paint with all the [A7//] colors of the [D] wind

[D] ... [Bm] ... <r>x2</r>
 
<s>(Verse)</s>
Come [D] run the hidden pine trails of [Bm] the forest
Come [D] taste the sun sweet berries of [F#m] the earth
[Bm] Come roll in all the riches all [G] around you
and for [Em//] once never [A7//] wonder what they're [Bm] worth

The [D] rain storm and the river are my [Bm] brothers
The [D] heron and the otter are my friends [F#m] ...
And [Bm] we are all connected to each [G] other
in a [Em7//] circle in a [A7//] hoop that never [D] ends

<s>(Bridge) slow down</s>
[F#m/]... How [G/]HI-IGH does the [F#m/] sycamore [Bm/] grow?
If you [C/] cut it down, then you'll [A/] never know
 
<s>(Chorus)</s>
And you[Bm]'ll never hear the wolf cry to [F#m//] the blue [G//] corn moon
For [Bm] whether we are white- or copper-[F#m]skinned
You need to [G//] sing with all the [A//] voices of the [Bm] mountain
You need to [G] paint with all the colors of the [Bm] wind

You can [Em/] own the earth [A/] and still 
all you [F#m/] own is earth [G/] until
<s>slow down</s>
... you can [Bm/] paint ... with all the 
[G/] colors ... [A7/] 
of the [D] wind
[D] ... [Bm] ... <r>x2</r>

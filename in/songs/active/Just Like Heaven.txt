[A]   [E7]   [Bm]   [D]   <small><b>(x4)</b></small> 

<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
"Show me, show me, [A] show me how you [E7] do that trick
The [Bm] one that makes me [D] scream" she said
"The [A] one that makes me [E7] laugh" she said
And [Bm] threw her arms [D] around my neck
[A] "Show me how you [E7] do it
And I [Bm] promise you, I [D] promise that
I'll run [A] away with you  [E7] ...
I'll run [Bm] away with you" [D] ...

[A]   [E7]   [Bm]   [D]   <small><b>(x4)</b></small> 

<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
[A] Spinning on that [E7] dizzy edge
I [Bm] kissed her face and [D] kissed her head
And [A] dreamed of all the [E7] different ways
I [Bm] had to make her [D] glow
[A] "Why are you so [E7] far away?" she [Bm] said
"Why won't you [D] ever know 
that I'm in [A] love with you [E7] ...
That I'm in [Bm] love with you" [D] ...

<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
[F#m] You
[G] Soft and only
[F#m] You
[G] Lost and lonely
[F#m] You
[G] Strange as angels
[D] Dancing in the deepest oceans

[D] Twisting in the water
You're just like a [A] dream  [E7] ...
You're just like a [Bm] dream  [D] ...

[A]   [E7]   [Bm]   [D]   <small><b>(x4)</b></small> 

<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
[A] Daylight licked me [E7] into shape
I [Bm] must have been [D] asleep for days
And [A] moving lips to [E7] breathe her name
I [Bm] opened up my [D] eyes
And [A] found myself [E7] alone, alone
[Bm] Alone above a [D] raging sea
That [A] stole the only [E7] girl I loved
And [Bm] drowned her deep [D] inside of me

<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
[F#m] You
[G] Soft and only
[F#m] You
[G] Lost and lonely
[F#m] You
[G] Just like heaven
[D/] ...

Some[G]body once [D] told me the 
[Am] world is gonna [C] roll me
I [G] ain't the sharpest [D] tool in the 
[Am] shed [C]
She was [G] looking kind of 
[D] dumb with her [Am] finger and her 
[C] thumb In the [G] shape of an 
[D] "L" on her [Am] forehead [C]

<b>Normal strums</b>
Well the [G] years start coming and they [D] don't stop coming 
[Am] fed to the rules and I [C] hit the ground running
[G] Didn't make sense not to [D] live for fun, your 
[Am] brain gets smart but your [C] head gets dumb
[G] So much to do, so [D] much to see, so what's 
[Am] wrong with taking the [C] back streets?
You'll [G] never know if you don't [D] go, 
you'll [Am]never shine if you don't [C] glow

[G] Hey now, you're an [C] all-star… 
get your [C#dim] game on, go [C] play
[G] Hey now, you're a [C] rock star… get the 
[C#dim] show on, get [C] paid
And [G] all that [C] glitters is [C#dim] gold [C]
Only shooting [G] stars [F] break the [C] mould [C]..

<b class="mark">(Verse Alternating)</b>
It's a [G] cool place and they [D] say it gets colder,
you're [Am] bundled up now, wait [C] till you get older
But the [G] meteor men beg to [D] differ, judging by the 
[Am] hole in the satellite [C] picture
The ice we [G] skate is getting pretty [D] thin, the water's getting 
[Am] warm so you might as well [C] swim
My world's on [G] fire, how ‘bout [D] yours? That's the way I 
[Am] like it and I never get [C]bored

Some[G]body once [D] asked could I 
[Am] spare some change for [C] gas
I need to [G] get myself a[D]way from 
this [Am] place [C]
I said [G] yep… what a con[D]cept, I could 
[Am] use a little fuel [C] myself
And we could [G] all use a [D] little [Am/] [stop] cha-a-a-a-ange

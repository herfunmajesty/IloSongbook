<i>(Intro)</i>
[Am][D][Em][Em] x2

<i>(Verse 1)</i>
When you get [Am] older, plainer, saner
Will you [D] remember all the danger 
we [Em] came from? [Em]

Burning like [Am] embers, falling tender
Long before the [D] days of no surrender
Years ago [Em]â€¦ and will you know?

<i>(Pre-chorus)</i>
So [Am] smoke'em if you got'em
'Cause it's [D] going down
[Em] All I ever wanted was [Em] you

[Am] I'll never get to heaven
'Cause I [D] don't know how
Let's [Em] raise a glass or [Em] two

<i>(Chorus)</i>
To all the things I've [Am] lost on you
Ooh, [D] oh 
Tell me are they [Em] lost on you?
Ooh, [C] oh
Just that you could [Am] cut me loose
Ooh, [D] oh

After everything I've [Em] lost on you
Is that [C] lost on you?

Oh oh oh oh [Am] ooh-ooh... oh [D] oh
Oh oh oh oh [Em] ooh... 
Is that [C] lost on you?
Oh oh oh oh [Am] ooh-ooh... oh [D] oh
Baby, is that [Em] lost on you?
Is that [C] lost on you?

<i>(Verse 2)</i>
Wish that I could [Am] see the machinations
Understand the [D] toil of expectations 
in [Em] your mind [Em]

Hold me like you [Am] never lost your patience
Tell me that you [D] love me more than hate me 
all the [Em] timeâ€¦ and you're still [Em] mine

<i>(Pre-chorus)</i>
So [Am] smoke'em if you got'em
'Cause it's [D] going down
[Em] All I ever wanted was [Em] you

Let's [Am] take a drink of heaven
This can [D] turn around
Let's [Em] raise a glass or [Em] two

<i>(Chorus)</i>
To all the things I've [Am] lost on you
Ooh, [D] oh 
Tell me are they [Em] lost on you?
Ooh, [C] oh
Just that you could [Am] cut me loose
Ooh, [D] oh

After everything I've [Em] lost on you
Is that [C] lost on you?
 
Oh oh oh oh [Am] ooh-ooh... oh [D] oh
Oh oh oh oh [Em] ooh... 
Is that [C] lost on you?
Oh oh oh oh [Am] ooh-ooh... oh [D] oh
Baby, is that [Em] lost on you?
Is that [C] lost on you?

<i>(Bridge)</i>
[Am][D][Em][C] (Whoa -oa -oa)
[Am][D]
Let's [Em/] raise a glass or [C/] two

<i>(Chorus)</i>
To all the things I've [Am] lost on you
Ooh, [D] oh 
Tell me are they [Em] lost on you?
Ooh, [C] oh
Just that you could [Am] cut me loose
OOH, [D] OOOH

After everything I've [Em] lost on you
Is that [C] lost on you?
 
<i>(Outro)</i>
Is that [Am/] lost on you? [D/][Em/][C/]
(O-ooh, o-ooh)
[Am/][D/][Em/][C/]
(O-ooh, o-oh)

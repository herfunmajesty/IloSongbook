<small><i>(Intro)</i></small>
[Em][A][Bm][Bm] x2

<small><i>(Verse 1)</i></small>
When you get [Em] older, plainer, saner
Will you [A] remember all the danger 
we [Bm] came from? [Bm]

Burning like [Em] embers, falling tender
Long before the [A] days of no surrender
Years ago [Bm]â€¦ and will you know?

<small><i>(Pre-chorus)</i></small>
So [Em] smoke'em if you got'em
'Cause it's [A] going down
[Bm] All I ever wanted was [Bm] you

[Em] I'll never get to heaven
'Cause I [A] don't know how
Let's [Bm] raise a glass or [Bm] two

<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
To all the things I've [Em] lost on you
Ooh, [A] oh 
Tell me are they [Bm] lost on you?
Ooh, [G] oh
Just that you could [Em] cut me loose
Ooh, [A] oh

After everything I've [Bm] lost on you
Is that [G] lost on you?

Oh oh oh oh [Em] ooh-ooh... oh [A] oh
Oh oh oh oh [Bm] ooh... 
Is that [G] lost on you?
Oh oh oh oh [Em] ooh-ooh... oh [A] oh
Baby, is that [Bm] lost on you?
Is that [G] lost on you?

<small><i>(Verse 2)</i></small>
Wish that I could [Em] see the machinations
Understand the [A] toil of expectations 
in [Bm] your mind [Bm]

Hold me like you [Em] never lost your patience
Tell me that you [A] love me more than hate me 
all the [Bm] timeâ€¦ and you're still [Bm] mine

<small><i>(Pre-chorus)</i></small>
So [Em] smoke'em if you got'em
'Cause it's [A] going down
[Bm] All I ever wanted was [Bm] you

Let's [Em] take a drink of heaven
This can [A] turn around
Let's [Bm] raise a glass or [Bm] two

<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
To all the things I've [Em] lost on you
Ooh, [A] oh 
Tell me are they [Bm] lost on you?
Ooh, [G] oh
Just that you could [Em] cut me loose
Ooh, [A] oh

After everything I've [Bm] lost on you
Is that [G] lost on you?
 
Oh oh oh oh [Em] ooh-ooh... oh [A] oh
Oh oh oh oh [Bm] ooh... 
Is that [G] lost on you?
Oh oh oh oh [Em] ooh-ooh... oh [A] oh
Baby, is that [Bm] lost on you?
Is that [G] lost on you?

<small><i>(Bridge)</i></small>
[Em][A][Bm][G] (Whoa -oa -oa)
[Em][A]
Let's [Bm/] raise a glass or [G/] two

<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
To all the things I've [Em] lost on you
Ooh, [A] oh 
Tell me are they [Bm] lost on you?
Ooh, [G] oh
Just that you could [Em] cut me loose
OOH, [A] OOOH

After everything I've [Bm] lost on you
Is that [G] lost on you?
 
<small><i>(Outro)</i></small>

(O-ooh, o-ooh)
[Em/][A/][Bm/][G/]
(O-ooh, o-oh)

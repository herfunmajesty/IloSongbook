<small><i>(Intro) down-up </i></small>
[G] ... [G] ... [G] ...

<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
[G]   Happiness hit her like a train on a [G]tra-a[Am]aa[Em]a-ack...
[G]   Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning [G]ba-a[Am]a-a[Em]a-ack...
She [G] hid around corners and she hid under beds
She [G] killed it with ki[Am]sses a[Em]nd from it she fle-e-ed
With [G] every bubble she sank with a drink
And [G] washed it a[Am]way down the [Em] kitchen sink

The [G] dog days are over
The [G] dog days are done
The [G] horses are [Am] comi-ing
So [Em] you better ru-un
 
<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
 
Run [G] fast for your mother, run fast for your father
[G] Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
[G] Leave all your love and your [Am] longing behind
You can't [Em] carry it with you if you want to survive
 
The [G] dog days are ove-er
The [G] dog days are do-oo-one
[G] Can you hear the ho[Am]rse-e-e-s?
'Cause [Em] he-ere they co-oo-[G]ome
 
[stop] 1..2..3
 
<small><i>(Bridge) slow, quiet</i></small>
And [G/] I-I [G/] never wanted 
[G/] anything [Am/] from you-[Em/]uu ...
Except [G/] for e-e-every-[G/]thing you had and 
[G/] what was left [Am/] after that [Em/] too, oh
 
<small><i>(Verse) down-up, loud again</i></small>
[G] Happiness hit her [G] like a bullet in the 
[G] baa-[Am]aa-[Em]ack.....
[G] Struck from a -- great height... 
[G] by someone who  should know [G]be-ee[Am]-etter than [Em] that
 
The [G] dog days are ove-e-er
The [G] dog days are done
[G] Can you hear the ho[Am]rse-es?
'Cause [Em] here they come [G] ...
 
<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
Run [G] fast for your mother, run fast for your father
[G] Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
[G] Leave all your love and your [Am] longing behind
You can't [Em] carry it with you if you want to survive
 
The [G] dog days are ove-e-er
The [G] dog days are do-o-o-one
[G] Can you hear the ho[Am]rse-e-e-es?
'Cause [Em] here they come
 
<small><i>(Outro)</i></small>
The [G] dog days are over
The [G] dog days are do-o-o-one
The [G] horses are co[Am]ming
So [Em] you better run
 
The [G] dog days are over
The [G] dog days are do-o-o-one
The [G] horses are co[Am]ming
So [Em] you better ru-u-[G]u-n
[G/]

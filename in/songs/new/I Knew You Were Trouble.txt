[F]Once upon a time… a few mistakes ago… 
[C]I was in your sights… you got 
me alone 
You [Dm]fou-ound me… you fou-ound me… 
you [Bb]fou-ound me-e-e-e 
I [F]guess you didn't care… and I guess I liked that… 
and [C]when I fell hard… 
you took a step back 
With[Dm]ou-out me… without-out me… 
with[Bb]ou-out me-e-e-e

[F]No apologies… he'll never see you cry… pre[C]tends he doesn't know… that 
he's the reason why 
You're [Dm]drow-owning… you're drow-owning… you're [Bb]drowni-i-i-ing 
Now I [F]heard you moved on… from whispers on the street… a [C]new notch in 
your belt… is all I'll ever be 
And [Dm]no-ow I see… no-ow I see…[Bb]no-ow I see-ee-ee-ee

[Dm]Me… and I rea-ea[Bb]lise… the blame is on [Bb]me, yeah

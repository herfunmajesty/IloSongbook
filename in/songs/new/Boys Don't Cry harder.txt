[A] ... [Bm] ... [C#m]  ...  [D] <b>x4</b>

<i><small>Verse</small></i>
[A] I would say I'm [Bm] sorry
If I [C#m] thought that it would [D] change your mind
[A] But I know that [Bm] this time
I have [C#m] said too much, been [D] too unkind

[C#m] I try to [Bm] laugh about it [C#m] cover it all up with [Bm] lies
[C#m] I try to [Bm] laugh about it [C#m] hiding the tears in my [Bm] eyes

<i><small>Chorus</i></small>
'Cause [A] boys [Bm]  don't [C#m]cry  [D/] ... [D/ C#m/ Bm/]
[A] Boys [Bm] don't [C#m] cry [D/] ... [D/ C#m/ Bm/]

<i><small>Verse</i></small>
[A] I would break down [Bm] at your feet
And [C#m] beg forgiveness [D] plead with you
[A] But I know that [Bm] it's too late
And [C#m] now there's nothing [D] I can do

[C#m] So I try to [Bm] laugh about it, [C#m] cover it all up with [Bm] lies
[C#m] I try to [Bm] laugh about it, [C#m] hiding the tears in my [Bm] eyes

<i><small>Chorus</i></small>
'Cause [A] boys [Bm] don't [C#m]  cry [D/] ... [D/ C#m/ Bm/]   
[A] Boys [Bm] don't [C#m] cry  [D/] ... [D/ C#m/ Bm/]    

<i><small>Verse</i></small>
[A] I would tell you [Bm] that I loved you
[C#m] If I thought that [D] you would stay
[A] But I know that [Bm] it's no use
And [C#m] you're already [D] gone away

<i><small>Bridge</i></small>
[E] Misjudged your [F#m] limits
[E] Pushed you too [F#m]far
[E] Took you for [F#m] granted
[D] I thought that you needed me [E] more more more

<i><small>Verse</i></small>
Now [A] I would do most [Bm] anything
To [C#m] get you back by my [D] side
[A] But I just [Bm] keep on laughing
[C#m] Hiding the tears in my [D] eyes

<i><small>Chorus</i></small>
'Cause [A] boys don't cry [Bm] ... [C#m] ...  [D/] ... [D/ C#m/ Bm/]
[A] Boys [Bm] don't [C#m] cry  [D/] ... [D/ C#m/ Bm/]
[A] ... [Bm] Boys don't cry [C#m] ... [D/] ... [D/ C#m/ Bm/]

[A/] ... [Bm/] ... [C#m/]  ...  [D/] ... [D/] [C#m/] [Bm/] [A/]

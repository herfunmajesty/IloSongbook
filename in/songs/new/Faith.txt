<s>(Intro)</s> 
[C] ... (mute)<r>x4</r>

<s>(Verse)</s>
Well I guess it would be [C] nice… if I could [C] touch your body 
I know not [F] everybody… has a body like [C]you 
But I’ve got to think [C] twice… before I [C] give my heart away 
And I know [F]all the games you play… ‘cause I play them too[C] 

Oh but I [F] need some time off… from [C] that emotion 
[F] Time to pick my heart up off the [C] floor 
Oh when that [F] love comes down with[Em//]out de[Am//]votion 
Well it [Dm] takes a strong man baby but I’m [G] showin’ you the door 

<s>(Chorus)</s>
Because I gotta have [C]faith… 
I gotta have [C] faith 
Because I gotta have [C] faith faith faith… 
I gotta have [C] faith, faith, faith

<s>(Verse)</s>
Ba[C]by… I know you’re [C] asking me to stay 
Say please, please, [F] please don’t go away 
You say I’m giving you the [C] blues 
Ma-a-ay[C]be… you mean [C] every word you say 
Can’t help but [F] think of yesterday 
And a lover who [C] tied me down to the lover boy rules 

Be[F]fore this river… be[C]comes an ocean 
Be[F]fore you throw my heart back on the [C]floor 
Oh baby I’ll [F] reconsider… my [Em//] foolish [Am//] notion 
Well I [Dm] need someone to hold me but I’ll 
[G] Wait for something more 

<s>(Chorus)</s>
Because I gotta have [C]faith… 
I gotta have [C] faith 
Because I gotta have [C] faith faith faith… 
I gotta have [C] faith, faith, faith

Be[F]fore this river… be[C]comes an ocean 
Be[F]fore you throw my heart back on the [C]floor 
Oh baby I’ll [F]reconsider… my [Em//] foolish [Am//] notion 
Well I [Dm] need someone to hold me but I’ll

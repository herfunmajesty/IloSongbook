<s>(Verse)</s>
All I [Eb] am is a [Cm] man
I want the[Gm] world in my[Bb] hands
I hate the [Eb] beach
But I[Cm] stand in Cali[Gm]fornia
with my toes in the [Bb] sand
Use the sleeves on my swea[Eb]ter
Let's have an a[Cm]dventure
Head in the [Gm] clouds but my gravity's ce[Bb]ntered
Touch my [Eb] neck and I'll touch [Cm] yours
You in those [Gm] little high waisted [Bb] shorts
 
<s>(Pre-Chorus)</s>
[Eb] Oh, she knows what I think about
[Cm]   And what I think about
[Gm]   One love, two mouths
[Bb]   One love, one house
[Eb]   No shirt, no blouse
[Cm]   Just us, you find out
[Gm] Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, [Bb] no
 
<s>(Chorus)</s>
'Cause it's too [Eb] co[Cm]ld whoa
For you [Gm] here
And [Bb] now
So let me [Eb] hold [Cm] whoa
Both your [Gm] hands in [Bb] the holes of my sweater
 
<s>(Verse)</s>
And if I [Eb] may just take your breath away
[Cm] I don't mind if there's not much to say
Some[Gm]times the silence guides your mind
So [Bb] move to a place so far away
[Eb]   The goosebumps start to race
The [Cm] minute that my left hand meets your waist
[Gm]   And then I watched your face
Put my [Bb] finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste ye[Eb]ah
 
These hearts adore
[Cm] Everyone the other beats hardest for
 
<s>(Pre-Chorus)</s>
[Gm]   Inside this place is warm
[Bb]   Outside it starts to pour
[Eb]   Coming down
[Cm]   One love, two mouths
[Gm]   One love, one house
[Bb]   No shirt, no blouse
[Eb]   Just us, you find out
[Cm] Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
[Gm] No No [Bb] No!
 
<s>(Chorus)</s>
'Cause it's too [Eb] cold [Cm] whoa
For you [Gm] here
And [Bb] now
So let me [Eb] hold [Cm] whoa
Both your [Gm] hands in [Bb] the holes of my sweater
 
'Cause it's too [Eb] cold [Cm] whoa
For you [Gm] here
And [Bb] now
 
So let me [Eb] hold [Cm] whoa
Both you[Gm]r hands in the[Bb] holes of my sweater,  [F] woah
 
<s>(Bridge)</s>
[Cm]   [Bb] [F] [F]
 
[Cm] ... Whoa,[Bb]   Whoa,  [F] Whoa, [N.C.] 
[Cm] ... Whoa,[Bb]   Whoa,  [F] Whoa, [F]
[Cm] ... Whoa,[Bb]   Whoa,  [F] Whoa, [F]
[Cm] ... Whoa,[Bb]   Whoa,  [F] Whoa, [F]

<s>(Chorus)</s>
'Cause it's too [Eb] cold [Cm] whoa
For you [Gm] here
And [Bb] now
So let me [Eb] hold [Cm] whoa
Both your [Gm] hands in [Bb] the holes of my sweater
 
'Cause it's too [Eb] cold [Cm] whoa
For you [Gm] here
And [Bb] now
let me [Eb] hold [Cm] whoa
Both your [Gm] hands in [Bb] the holes of my sweater [Eb/] ...
 
<s>(Outro)</s>
And it's too [Cm/] cold, it's too [Gm/] cold
The [Bb/] holes of my sweater.

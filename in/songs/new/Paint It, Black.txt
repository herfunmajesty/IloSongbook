[EM]I see a red door and I [B]want it painted black
[EM]No colors anymore, I [B]want them to turn black
[EM]I [D]see the [G]girls walk by [D]dressed in [EM]their summer clothes
[EM]I [D]have to [G]turn my [D]head [A]until my darkness [B]goes

[Em]I see a line of cars and [B]they're all painted black
[Em]With flowers and my love, both [B]never to come back
[Em]I [D]see people [G]turn their [D]heads and [Em]quickly look away
[Em]Like a [D]new born [G]baby, [D]it just [A]happens every [B]day

[Em]I look inside myself and [B]see my heart is black
[Em]I see my red door, I [B]must have it painted black
[Em]Maybe [D]then I'll [G]fade [D]away and [Em]not have to face the facts
[Em]It's not [D]easy [G]facing [D]up, when [A]your whole world is [B]black

[Em]No more will my green sea go [B]turn a deeper blue
[Em]I could not foresee this thing [B]happening to you
[Em]If I look hard enough into the [B]settin' sun
[Em]My love will laugh with me before [B]the mornin' comes

[EM]I see a red door and I [B]want it painted black
[EM]No colors anymore, I [B]want them to turn black
[EM]I [D]see the [G]girls walk by [D]dressed in [EM]their summer clothes
[EM]I [D]have to [G]turn my [D]head [A]until my darkness [B]goes

[Em]Hmm, hmm, [B]hmm, hmm
[Em]Hmm, hmm, [B]hmm, hmm

[Em]I wanna see it [B]painted, painted black
[Em]Black as night, [B]black as coal
[Em]I wanna see the sun [B]blotted out from the sky
[Em]I wanna see it painted, [B]painted, painted, painted black
Yeah

[Em]Hmm, hmm, [B]hmm, hmm
[Em]Hmm, hmm, [B]hmm, hmm

[Am]... [Dm]... [E7]... [E7/] - [F/][G/] x2

[A] You could never know [D] what it's like
Your [E7] blood like winter freezes [A] just like ice
And there's [Bm7] cold lonely light that [Bm7//] shines from [E7//] you
You'll [F#m] wind up like the wreck you [D] hide behind that
[Bm7//] Mask you [A//] use [A]

[A] And did you think this fool could [D] never win
Well [E7] look at me I'm a-comin' [A] back again
I got a [Bm7] taste of love in a [Bm7//] simple [E7//] way
And if you [F#m] need-to-know while I'm still stan-[D]-ding
You just [Bm7//] fade a[A//]wayâ€¦ [A]
[A] donâ€™t you know

<small><i>(chorus)</i></small>
[Am] I'm still [Am] standing better than
I [Em7] ever didâ€¦ [Em7] lookin' like
A [Dm] true survivorâ€¦ [Dm] feelin' like
A [F] little kid [G]
[Am] I'm still [Am] standing after
[Em7] All this time [Em7]
Pickin' up the [Dm] pieces of my life [Dm] without you
[E7]On my mind [E7]
I'm still [Am] standing [Dm]yeah, yeah
[E7]Yeah [E7]
I'm still [Am]standing [Dm]yeah, yeah
[E7]Yeah [E7/] - [F/][G/] 

[A] Once I never could've [D] hoped to win
You [E7] starting down the road leaving [A] me again
The [Bm7] threats you made were meant to [Bm7//] cut me [E7//] down 
and if our [F#m] Love was just a [D] circus you'd be
A [Bm7//] clown by [A//] now

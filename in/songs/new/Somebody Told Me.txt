[Am] ... [Dm]

<i>Verse</i>
[Am] Breaking my back just to [Am] know your name
[Am] Seventeen tracks and I've [Am] had it with this 
[Dm] game     [F] ...
[Am] I'm breaking my back just to [Am] know your name
[Am] But heaven ain't close in a [Am] place like this
[Am] Anything goes but [Am] don't blink you 
[Dm] might miss   [F] ...
[Am]Cause heaven ain't close in a [Am] place like this
[Am]I said heaven ain't close in a [Am] place like this
[F] Bring it back down, [G] bring it back down [Am] tonight
[Am] (o-o-o)
[F] Never thought I'd let [F] a rumor ruin [G] my moonlight
[G/][G/]

<i>Chorus</i>
Well somebody [Am] told me
You had a [F] boyfriend
Who looked like a [G] girlfriend
That I had in [E7] February of [Am] last year
It's not [F] confidential
I've got [G] potential
[NC]...

<i>Verse</i>
[Am] Ready? Let's roll onto [Am] something new
[Am] Taking its toll and I'm [Am] leaving without you-u-u   
[Dm] ... [F] ...
[Am] Cause heaven ain't close [Am] in a place like this
[Am] I said heaven ain't close [Am] in a place like this

[F] Never thought I'd let [F] a rumor ruin [G] my moonlight

A rushin', a [E7] rushin' around

<i>Bridge</i>
[F] Pace [G] yourself from [Dm] me [Dm] 
I said [C] maybe [Dm] baby [F] please  [F]

Mr. [C] Sandman, [B7] bring me a dream.
[E7] make him the cutest that [A7] I've ever seen.
[D7] Give him two lips like [G7] roses and clover,
[C] then tell him [Am] that his lonesome [D7] nights are [G7] over.

[C] Sandman, [B7] I'm so alone.
[E7] Don't have nobody to [A7] call my own.
[Dm] Please turn on your magic [Fm] beam,
Mr. [C/] Sand[Am/]man, [D7/] bring me [G7/] a [C] dream.

<i>Mr. [C] Sandman [B7] bring us a dream.
[E7] Give him a pair of eyes with a [A7] come-hither gleam.
Give him a [D7] lonely heart like [G7] Pagliacci,
[C] and lots of [Am]  wavy hair like [D7] Liber[G7]ace.</i>

Sandman, this vision of mine
Has Jared Leto's eyes that shine
He has Jason Momoa's ravishing smile
As well as Henry Cavill's charming style

[C] Mr. Sandman, [B7] someone to hold,
[E7] would be so peachy [A7] before we're too old.
So [Dm] please turn on your magic [Fm] beam.
Mr. [C/] Sand[Am/]man, [D7/] bring us, 
[C/] please, [Am/] please, [D7] bring us..

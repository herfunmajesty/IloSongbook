			<b> Who we are</b><br>We're a group of amateur ukulele players comming from different cultures from all around the world, who at least temporarily dropped their anchors in Cracow. We meet almost every Tuesday in a tiny Hawaiian restobar in Kazimierz to jam togerther and sing our guts out. We like to pull some strings and we have fun doing it TOGETHER, diving in wonderful atmosphere of the place to charge our batteries for another week of hard work :)<hr><br><br>
			
			<b> Where & when we meet</b><br>We gather on Tuesdays evenings at 19.30 pm in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HiloKrakow">Hilo Kraków</a> and we play till 22.00. Usually some of us hang out afterwards in some other bar nearby to chat, have some snacks or drinks. All meetings are preanounced on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ukulelekrakowmeetup">Facebook</a>, as well as any worth mentioning abnormalities or aberrations from our routine.<br><br>

			<b> What's the drill</b><br>We play popular songs (in English) - some classics, some reasonably fresh - always following our unified songbook. Everyone gets a chance to choose a song we play next - once it's finally his turn in a seemingly neverending queue, as we usually gather 10 to 15 ehtusiasts. We start with easy, beginner friendly songs, gradualy including more difficult ones. We play by chords, occasionaly adding some riffs, but our main goal is to have fun together, not to shread ;). 
			<br><br> To keep at least appearnace of some order we always have leader to explain stuff if necessary and start the chosen song, so everyone can pick up the right tempo and strumming pattern. As friendly as this may sound, beware not to bring instruments other then ukulele or he will certenly release the Kraken.
<hr><br><br>
			<b> Who can join</b><br> Hmmm, everyone?... :D <br><br>All levels are welcome. Really, all levels. If you play - you are invited (even if you started playing yesterday). If you always wanted to learn<small>*</small> to play some instrument and you want to check us out - you're invited! Even if you don't have your own uke<small>**</small> and just fancy singing - yes, you're invited. Or maybe you just want see how it looks like but you're shy as fuck? Good for you - come to see us - we've got plenty of shy people inside :D <br>Since we are all amateurs, we make funny mistakes on daily basis, but we don't worry all that much about them. Unless the leader makes them - in that case we laugh hard rolling on the floor.<br><br>

<small>* Even though we don't teach, you'll propably meet someone who can show you this and that or answer some troubling questions. From our experience playing in a group and observing more advanced playeres proved to be good enough way to inspire and learn.</small>
<br><small>** Here you probably expect our offer to lend you one, but nope - we don't bring additional instruments to borrow :P <br>Still it's a good place to check if u want to buy, what model, size and such.</small></b><hr><br><br>
			<b>Sum up & some links</b><br>			
Planning to join us? Consider taking a look at our songbook on the main page or checking out some of the tracks from the complete playlist on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/41lDThnftKnYaSYz9gB6RQ">Spotify</a> or <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLgk_ryT1yuq5mS78wHzVmOAaEttjkiyO&si=vt9wdFQXIVsFz3Ra">YouTube<a>. <br><br> If despite of all what you read here about us we still seem beyond reach or - God forbid - profound, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@krakowukulele">live recordings</a> should dispell all those misconceptions.<br><br> See you soon!<hr><br>
